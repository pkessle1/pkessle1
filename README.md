### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kess, a barista and a junior student at Arizona State University with a Graphic Information Technology major with a focus on User Experience.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about user experience design and some basic knowledge of HTML/CSS
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a suggestion from people who love to share some knowledge about user experience design or even HTML.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about Thailand, especially Thai food, because I was born and grew up in Thailand. Another topic that I am always excited to talk about is my baby boy cat, Xavier, who just turned one year old recently, and he is my first cat.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm originally from Thailand and moved to Seattle around four years ago(right before the pandemic started), and I have lived in Seattle ever since then.
- What I want to do after graduation is to become a UX designer (User Experience designer). I had never heard about UX design until four years ago on YouTube, and I was curious about its name, UX, so I decided to watch the video to find out what it is.
  After watching a video, everything about UX design topic area sounded very interesting to me, and I decided to read more about what UX designers do exactly and why is it different than a graphic designer. 
- I recently thought that it would be better to gain some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS as well, so I decided to take a class called Introduction to Web Authoring to learn more about HTML and CSS, and I'm enjoying the class so far.

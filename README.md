### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kess

 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about user experience design and some basic knowledge of HTML
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a suggestion from people who loves to share some knowledge about user experience design
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about Thailand, espeically foods, because I was born and grew up in Thailand
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm originally from Thailand and moved to Seattle around four years ago(right before the pandemic started), and I have been living in Seattle ever since then.
Excited to join this community and gain more knowledge about HTML

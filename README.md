### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kess. I am a barista and a senior at Arizona State University. I major in Graphic Information Technology, with a focus on User Experience.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about user experience design and some basic knowledge of HTML/CSS
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a suggestion from people who love to share some knowledge about user experience design or even HTML.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about Thailand, especially Thai food and culture, because I was born and grew up in Thailand. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm originally from Thailand and moved to Seattle around five years ago(right before the pandemic started), and I have lived in Seattle ever since.
- What I want to do after graduation is to become a UX designer (User Experience designer). I had never heard about UX design until five years ago on YouTube, and I was curious about its name, UX, so I decided to watch the video to find out what it is.
  After watching a video, everything about the UX design topic area sounded very interesting to me, so I decided to read more about what UX designers do exactly and why they are different from graphic designers. 
I recently thought that it would be better to gain some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS as well, so I decided to take a class called Introduction to Web Authoring to learn more about them. I'm enjoying the class so far.
